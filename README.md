<h1>A feedforward neural network using python libraries (tensorflow/sklearn...)</h1>
A simple artificial neural network, which has 3 hidden layers and 40 neurons each, that I used for my graduation project. Im currently working on a virsion that trains and tests the network without using any libraries. It is a model that predicts a soil compaction value based on factors like humidity, weight of equipment used ... 
In addition to predicting soil compaction, this model offers a valuable feature that allows users to determine the optimal value of specific parameters. For instance, if a user wishes to find the ideal soil moisture level to minimize compaction, they can input all other relevant measurements into the model. The model can then generate a graph showing how different humidity levels influence soil compaction. This graphical insight helps users make informed decisions about maintaining optimal soil conditions
