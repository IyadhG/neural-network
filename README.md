<h1>An artificial neural network using python libraries (tensorflow/sklearn...)</h1>
<p>A simple artificial neural network, which has 3 hidden layers and 40 neurons each, that I used for my graduation project. Im currently working on a virsion that trains and tests the network without using any libraries. It is a model that predicts a soil compaction value based on factors like humidity, weight of equipment used and it's number of passes through the soil, pressure exerted on the soil and depth to be inspected,

In addition to predicting soil compaction, this model offers a valuable feature that allows users to determine the optimal value of specific parameters. For instance, if a user wishes to find the ideal soil moisture level to minimize compaction, they can input all other relevant measurements into the model. The model can then generate a graph showing how different humidity levels influence soil compaction. This graphical insight helps users make informed decisions about maintaining optimal soil conditions.
